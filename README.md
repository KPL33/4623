# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor Challenge - Week 1

*User Story: AS A Web Developer, I WANT to revise the files that the client has provided SO THAT it meets all of the client's acceptance criteria.


*Acceptance Criteria: Using **scenario-oriented criteria**, I have satisfied the requests of the client in the following manner...
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find only semantic HTML elements, with "vague" elements replaced by more specific labels that clearly define that element's purpose.

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order, matching positions of those sections on the page below.

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title, which was changed from "Website" to "Welcome to Horiseon"
